Write a Java program to print the sum (addition), multiply, subtract, divide and remainder of two numbers.
Test Data:
Input first number: 125
Input second number: 24
Expected Output :
125 + 24 = 149
125 - 24 = 101
125 x 24 = 3000
125 / 24 = 5
125 mod 24 = 5

errors occored: 1

here was the code i tried at the beginning

import java.util.Scanner;
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.print("Input first number: ");
        double num1 = in.nextDouble();
        System.out.print("Input second number: ");
        double num2 = in.nextDouble();
        System.out.println(num1+" + "+num2+" = "+num1+num2);
        System.out.println(num1+" - "+num2+" = "+num1-num2);
        System.out.println(num1+" * "+num2+" = "+num1*num2);
        System.out.println(num1+" / "+num2+" = "+num1/num2);
        System.out.println(num1+" mod "+num2+" = "+num1%num2);
    }
}

in this code, I get the following error
operator "-" cannot be applied to 'java.lang.String', 'double'

The reason is I was trying to subtract a string from a string
The solution is to make the calculations first and then print the output
